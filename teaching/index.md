Education is an important part of the teaching, curatorial, and public programming work I undertake. In the past, I have taught courses in architectural history and criticism at the University of Houston's Gerald D. Hines College of Architecture and Design, Pratt Institute's Graduate Center for Planning and the Environment, and the Art History and Visual Culture Program at Bard College (Annandale-on-Hudson). But in addition to the standard classroom settings, my more recent work engages with other formats and mediums, for example digital history. 

Across these different formats and sites, my pedagogic methods advance an interdisciplinary, global framework for the study of architecture and urbanism. In Fall 2018, at Bard, I taught “Talking Architecture,” an introductory class on how to think about architecture, emphasizing issues of ethics, labor, and maintenance alongside visual aesthetics, acoustics, and smell. In Spring 2019, I taught a graduate seminar on American architecture and urban history to preservation students at Pratt Institute, teaching recent immigrant environments alongside the more typical study of the architectural environments of European settlers. Most recently, I taught several courses at the University of Houston. In a required graduate seminar on Modern Architecture and Urbanism, I built upon and further diversified an existing syllabus. 

Independently, I am also developing several upper-level syllabi. A class titled “Kingdoms of God” studies religion’s impact on secular art and architecture in the U.S. Other syllabi examine postwar modernism (focusing on the non-West), the politics of museums, American philanthropy’s impact on art practices and the built environment worldwide, architecture’s intersection with nationalism and internationalism, and Orientalism.
