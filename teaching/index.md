I am currently a Visiting Assistant Professor at Pratt Institute's Graduate Center for Planning and the Environment, and I have previously taught in the Art History and Visual Culture Program at Bard College (Annandale-on-Hudson). 

My teaching methods advance an interdisciplinary, global framework for the study of architecture and urbanism. In Fall 2018, at Bard, I taught “Talking Architecture,” an introductory class on how to think about architecture, emphasizing issues of ethics and maintenance alongside visual aesthetics, acoustics, and smell. This Spring, I am teaching a graduate seminar on American architecture and urban history to preservation students at Pratt Institute, emphasizing recent immigrant environments alongside the more typical study of the architectural environments of European settlers. Independently, I am also developing several upper-level syllabi. A class titled “Kingdoms of God” studies religion’s impact on secular art and architecture in the U.S. Other syllabi examine postwar modernism (focusing on the non-West), the politics of museums, American philanthropy’s impact on art practices and the built environment worldwide, architecture’s intersection with nationalism and internationalism, and Orientalism.
