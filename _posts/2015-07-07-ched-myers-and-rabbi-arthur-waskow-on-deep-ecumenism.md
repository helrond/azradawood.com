Bioregional Theology & Practices,” including a visit to the [Center and Library for the Bible and Social Justice at Stony Point](http://clbsj.org/).   Rabbis Arthur Waskow of the Shalom Center and Phyllis Berman are the wisdom leaders for The Summer Institute of the Stony Point Center during the same week.

Ched will bring his Maryknoll Institute class to the Stony Point Center for the day and will they participate in the Summer Institute on campus. During the evening he and Arthur will lead an open, public discussion on Deep Ecumenism and touching on watershed discipleship and the practice of permaculture.

Ched says of his work:

>For the last 30 years I have sought to respond to the discipleship call in a variety of ways: as an activist, writer, community builder and popular educator. It is my conviction that the First World church can only be renewed by rediscovering its witness to God’s dream of the Peaceable Kingdom and justice for all. Historically in the U.S., people of faith have been on the forefront of struggles for social change (in our generation this has included movements for civil rights, labor solidarity, immigrant and refugee rights and disarmament). Today we need to animate a new generation of ecumenical leadership committed both to the gospel and to social change. In the metaphor of Jesus, we must be willing to “address the mountain” of injustice.
