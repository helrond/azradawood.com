This month's edition of [Sojourners magazine](http://sojo.net/magazine) contains an extremely positive review of Liberating Biblical Study by [Tim Kumfer](http://timkumfer.wordpress.com/), director of the [Servant Leadership School](http://slschool.org/programs/servant-leadership-school.html) in Washington, D.C., and an editor of [inwardoutward.org](http://inwardoutward.org/).

The review says the anthology, "begins to cultivate a different way of seeing, one in which the Great Story becomes more deeply our own, often in surprising ways. It aids in our discernment of the ongoing biblical drama of liberation and invites us to join the Spirit’s renewing work out in the streets."
