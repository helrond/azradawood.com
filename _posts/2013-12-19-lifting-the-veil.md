The Presbyterian Peace Fellowship Palestine/Israel Delegation and their InterFaith PeaceBuilders Delegation Organizers will spend an evening at the Center & Library for the Bible and Social Justice for a sponsored dialogue on Bruce Scott's study "When Time Ends: The Victory of Forgiveness at Armageddon". The program on January 4, 2014 will start at 7:00 p.m. and will be held at the Stony Point Center, Stony Point, New York.

Scott’s examination of Christian apocalyptic literature is a highly valuable work which systematically defines and orders the history of prophetic, apocalyptic and revelatory narratives in a clear and persuasive manner. The exegesis is informative and apt for both his intellectual purposes and as a vehicle for examining the ideological uses of apocalyptic narratives in justifying political support for religious conflict in the Middle East by Christian Fundamentalists.

The book’s argument, in a sentence: “Instead of postponing the kingdom of God to the future, voices of prophecy and apocalypse in the Bible encourage Christians to realize the kingdom on earth now through forgiveness, compassion, and reconciliation, persevering in their faith despite the overwhelming injustice and violence that surrounds them.”

A graduate of Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary with a Master of Divinity degree, and retired Director of the Kentucky Division of Mental Health, Scott is currently an officer or director for several nonprofit associations in the fields of environmental and mental health in the Frankfort, Kentucky area. Additional information about the book can be found at Scott’s blog [www.WhenTimeEnds.net](http://www.WhenTimeEnds.net). Copies of the book are available in the Stony Point Center Bookstore.
