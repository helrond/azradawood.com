**Our Problems Stem From Our Acceptance of this Filthy Rotten System***

© Charlie King, May 2009

Eight years we bravely battled Bush – that smug, self-righteous frat boy on a bender

We marched against his endless war, we rallied every race and class and gender

Our hearts were new, our states were blue, our aim was true & yet we always missed him

Perhaps our problems stem from our acceptance of this filthy rotten system

We caucused, called, and canvassed for Barack, raised cash and voter registration

Triumphantly we tuned in to debate, acceptance speech, inauguration

Joe Biden kvelled “He talks so well!” And when he won, by god I could’ve kissed him

But don’t our problems stem from our acceptance of this filthy rotten system?

Then having vanquished Bush & Darth we all return to home & hearth & cable

We thought we’d crashed the party, but we ain’t even sitting at the table

Now corporate flacks and party hacks surround Barack, all eager to assist him

D’ya think our problems stem from our acceptance of this filthy rotten system?

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  We work within the system while we visualize a peaceful world ahead<br /> We vote the lesser evil, pay our taxes, raise our children, earn our bread<br /> Our lives replay like Groundhog’s Day & every day we pray it will be different<br /> The faces change, the mighty fall, the tables turn but still and all<br /> The setting sun salutes the same old system
</p>

And winners croon the same old tune “Forget the past, why waste your time & tears?

Or hoping for a better future – there’s a laugh – it’s been like this for years.

Go with the flow, the status quo, our leaders know - it’s useless to resist them.”

But if our problems stem from our acceptance of this filthy rotten system

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Then mourn the dead and fight like hell and when in doubt, Resist! Rebel!<br /> Remember Rome first rose, then fell, and so must ev’ry system.
