In November  of last year, The Center and Library for the Bible and Social Justice spent a day with Rev. Osagyefo Sekou who presented on Birmingham and the Bible, and, as he said, Dr. King as hermeneute. We were able to capture his remarks on video and have now edited them to share. With appreciation to Warren Cooper and the Stony Point Center:
