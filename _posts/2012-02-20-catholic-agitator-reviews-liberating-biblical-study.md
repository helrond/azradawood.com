_[The Catholic Agitator](http://lacatholicworker.org/our-newspaper-the-catholic-agitator)_, the newspaper of the [Los Angeles  Catholic Worker](http://lacatholicworker.org), [published a review](http://lacatholicworker.org/agitator/CatholicAgitator-2012-2.pdf) of _Liberating Biblical Study_ by Theo Kayser. The review contextualizes _Liberating Biblical Study_ in the continuing tradition of "clarification of thought" as articulated by [Catholic Worker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Worker_Movement) co-founder [Peter Maurin](http://www.catholicworker.org/roundtable/index.cfm).

"When all is said and done," Kayser says, "this book presents for us a snapshot of our movement with all of its various aspects. It helps us to consider where we are and where we are going, in the hope that together activists, artists, and scholars can become one and the same as we further the Kingdom."
