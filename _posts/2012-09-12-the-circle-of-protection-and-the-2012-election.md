Today's Twitter and blog buzz here at the CLBSJ has centered around economics and poverty. [Sojourners](http://sojo.net) has a link on their main page to [A Circle of Protection](http://www.circleofprotection.us/), a site displaying videos from this year's Presidential candidates as they respond to issues of poverty. The organization is made up of denominational leaders and is working with the [National Council of Churches](http://www.nccendpoverty.org/praythevote/), among others. It attempts to tackle the question of political platforms from the standpoint of "the least of these" (Matthew 25:45).

As we approach questions of leadership, justice, and scripture, we have the opportunity to speak and act as God would have us do, and to ask the most powerful people in our nation what tack they would take to eliminate poverty. What do you hope to hear our presidential candidates say? What does a Scriptural opposition to poverty in this country and in the world look like? Where does God's Word inspire you to combat the trap of poverty in your life?
