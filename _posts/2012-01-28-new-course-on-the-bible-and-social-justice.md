CLBSJ Board member Matthew JM Coomber has developed and is teaching a new course on the Bible and Social Justice. The class, which is being taught for the first time this semester at [St. Ambrose University](http://www.sau.edu/) (Davenport, IA), strives to "explore how the ancient texts of the Bible have been, are, and might be used to address a range of social-justice issues, ranging from empire to the environment."
