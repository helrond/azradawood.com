With the arrival of our new Interim Director of Communications, social media will be a greater focus of ministry and communication. Social media outlets such as blogs, [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Center-Library-for-the-Bible-and-Social-Justice/300474260002851), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/clbsj), and others are playing a critical role in the development of the 21st Century Church, as well as in 21st Century activism and advocacy.

And so we ask the question to you - what are the publications and blogs that are most meaningful to you as you engage with questions of justice and scripture? Who are the people you follow on Twitter with insightful links or thoughtful replies? Where do you go online to get your Bible and Social Justice fix?
