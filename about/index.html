  <p>The Center and Library for the Bible and Social Justice connects scholars, students, clergy, activists, and community organizers who often work separately and without the rich resources and insights they are capable of offering one another.</p>

  <p>We provide resources to both biblically informed activists and justice oriented scholars including books, periodicals, archival and electronic data in biblical studies and other fields germane to its mission and vision. We aim to create a synergy of theory and practice in a dynamic educational climate that will make full use of the Center and Library resources.</p>

  <p>In addition, The Center and Library offers ongoing educational programs of lectures, seminars, and conferences on topics and problems central to the social critical study of the Bible and to an empowering use of the Bible for enacting social justice today.</p>
