The Newark School of Theology is an ecumenical and interfaith school of theology for persons who desire to take advanced courses in theology without having first to matriculate at a school whose primary mission is professional education for the ordained ministry. All of our courses are taught at the upper-division or master’s level of university and seminary study by teachers who have earned graduate degrees.

Our mission is to ground the ministries of pastors and lay persons by offering high quality seminary level theological education at an affordable cost. The school is open to all who are able to do the course work, regardless of faith tradition—or lack of a faith tradition—and any other circumstance.

Certificate programs are offered in Theological Studies, Systematic Theology, Biblical Studies, Pastoral Counseling, Diaconal Studies, and Chaplaincy. Classes are offered in the Bible, Christian Theology, Theological Ethics, Church History, Jewish Studies, World Religions, Counseling, Biblical Hebrew, New Testament Greek, Homiletics, and Christian Education.

Classes are small (most are from five to ten members) in order to offer students opportunities to be fully engaged in classroom activities. Our students come from a variety of educational, religious, economic, and ethnic backgrounds. Commitment to the academic study of theology in an open and pluralistic environment is what unites our diverse student body and faculty into a single learning community.

We offer college credit recommendation at the graduate and upper-division undergraduate level for eleven of our courses through the Department of Education of the State of New York (NCCRS). This means that students at NST may earn one full year of college credit through our college completion program. Courses taken for college credit recommendation at The Newark School of Theology may be used at thousands of colleges and universities throughout the United States.

The Newark School of Theology is located in downtown Newark close to The New Jersey Performing Arts Center. Safe, lighted parking is available at the school. Classes are held in the evening for the convenience of students who work during the day.
