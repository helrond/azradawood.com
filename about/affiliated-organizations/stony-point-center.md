Welcoming Across Boundaries, Nurturing Inclusive Community, Cultivating Peace and Justice

A Multifaith Commitment to Radical Hospitality Affirmed by the Presbyterian Church (USA)

Welcoming Across Boundaries by providing overnight and day-use accommodations and meeting spaces for individuals and groups. We offer delicious, locally-sourced food; simple, comfortable guestrooms; and a caring touch that honors the distinctive needs of each guest.

Nurturing Inclusive Community by respecting the uniqueness of each person. We practice courageous conversations, study of sacred texts, faithful action, and the creative arts.

Cultivating Peace and Justice by supporting the multifaith movement for nonviolence and eco-social justice. We engage in networking, human rights accompaniment, advocacy, coalition building, and nonviolent direct action.
