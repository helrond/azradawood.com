_Unbound: An Interactive Journal of Christian Social Justice_ (“Unbound“) is an online journal and community that examines, expresses, and provokes social justice as inspired by the prophetic gospel of Jesus Christ. As both a journal and a forum for conversation, action and community building, _Unbound_ is at once the inheritor of the print journal _Church & Society_ (98 years running) and the innovator of an interactive approach to supporting social ministry. This means we are not solely a journal, nor solely another website or news outlet.
