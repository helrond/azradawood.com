    <p>
      I am an architectural historian, educator, and curator. Focusing on the built environments and technologies of the United States, my work critically engages issues of social engineering, philanthropy, religion, and internationalism. I completed my PhD in 2018 from MIT's Aga Khan Program for Islamic
      Architecture and the History, Theory and Criticism of Architecture and
      Art program. Prior to embarking upon my academic and curatorial careers, I studied and practiced architecture.

    <p>
      My <a href="/teaching/">teaching</a>, curatorial, and <a href="/design/">architectural</a> careers have spanned Houston, New
      York City, Cambridge (MA), and Karachi.

    <p>
      Currently I am an Andrew W. Mellon Postdoctoral Curatorial
      Fellow at the Museum of the City of New York. Prior to this position, I held the Emerging
      Scholar Fellowship at the University of Houston’s Gerald D. Hines College of
      Architecture and Design.
