    <p>
      I am an architect, educator, and a historian of architecture of the
      modern period, engaging with the themes of philanthropy, religion, and
      internationalism in the built environments of the U.S. empire. I
      completed my PhD in 2018 from MIT's Aga Khan Program for Islamic
      Architecture and the History, Theory and Criticism of Architecture and
      Art program.

    <p>
      My <a href="/teaching/">teaching</a>, <a href="/research/">research</a>, and <a href="/design/">architectural</a> careers have spanned Texas, New
      York City, Boston, and Karachi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently I am an Andrew W. Mellon Postdoctoral Curatorial
      Fellow at the Museum of the City of New York. Prior to this, I held the Emerging
      Scholar Fellowship at the University of Houstonâ€™s Gerald D. Hines College of
      Architecture and Design.
