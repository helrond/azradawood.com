    <p>
      I am a historian, architect, educator, and curator. My work focuses on built environments and artistic practices, studying these within both hyperlocal and global contexts. I am particularly drawn to issues related to diaspora and immigration, internationalism, critical perspectives on philanthropy, and religion. I completed my PhD in 2018 from MIT's Aga Khan Program
      for Islamic Architecture and the History, Theory and Criticism of Architecture
      and Art program.

      My teaching, research/writing, <a href="/design/">architectural</a>, and curatorial/public-history careers have spanned Austin, Cambridge (MA), Houston, Karachi, and New
      York City. For an overview of my work, <a href="/cv/">see my CV</a>.

      Most recently, I was the Andrew W. Mellon Postdoctoral Curatorial Fellow at the
      Museum of the City of New York. Prior to this position, I held the Emerging
      Scholar Fellowship at the University of Houstonâ€™s Gerald D. Hines College of
      Architecture and Design.
