    <p>
      I am an architectural historian, educator, and curator. My work focuses on the built environments and technologies of the United States, studying these within a global context. My projects and writings critically engage with the topics of social engineering and philanthropy, race and religion, diaspora and immigration, and internationalism. I completed my PhD in 2018 from MIT's Aga Khan Program
      for Islamic Architecture and the History, Theory and Criticism of Architecture
      and Art program. Prior to embarking upon my academic and curatorial
      careers, I studied and practiced architecture.

      My <a href="/teaching/">teaching</a>, curatorial and public history, research and writing, and <a href="/design/">architectural</a> careers have spanned Austin, Cambridge (MA), Houston, Karachi, and New
      York City. For an overview of my work, <a href="/cv/">see my CV</a>.

      Currently I am an Andrew W. Mellon Postdoctoral Curatorial Fellow at the
      Museum of the City of New York. Prior to this position, I held the Emerging
      Scholar Fellowship at the University of Houstonâ€™s Gerald D. Hines College of
      Architecture and Design.
