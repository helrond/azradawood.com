    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      Azra Dawood, PhD is an independent historian, architect, curator, and educator. Her work focuses on built
      environments and art practices, studying these within both hyperlocal and global contexts. She
      is particularly drawn to topics related to cultural pluralism (as evident in sports), religion and secularism, empire and
      philanthropy, and the environment. Azra has practiced architecture in Karachi, Austin, and New York City. After
      receiving a doctorate in architectural history from MIT's History, Theory and Criticism of
      Architecture and Art program and the Aga Khan Program for Islamic Architecture she has
      taught at University of Houston, Bard College, and Pratt Institute.
    </p>
    <p>
      She is currently working on both academic and public-history projects, including a manuscript
      about the institutional projects financed by the Rockefeller philanthropic network in the early-
      twentieth century, reading these from the perspectives of immigration, the network's pursuit
      of social engineering, and early-twentieth century theological movements. She has published a
      related article in The Journal of Architecture, titled <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/13602365.2019.1698635">“Building 'Brotherhood': John D. Rockefeller
      Jr. and the Foundations of New York City's International Student House.”</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Azra is the curator of <a href="https://www.mcny.org/exhibition/city-faith">City of Faith: Religion, Activism, and Urban Space</a>, which just closed at the
      Museum of the City of New York. She previously curated a web-based interactive <a href="https://mcny.nyc/nyresponds/timeline/">timeline</a>
      showing how the COVID-19 pandemic and 2020's Black Lives Matter protests transformed
      public space and life in NYC. Her curatorial projects center socially-engaged approaches to
      public history.
