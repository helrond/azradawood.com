I have worked as a designer and project manager on loft and brownstone renovations in Manhattan and Brooklyn. These spaces have been mostly single-family residences with a minimalist aesthetic. My responsibilities have included schematic design, design development, approvals processes at the Department of Buildings (DOB) and the Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC), preparation of construction drawings and specifications, bidding and negotiations with General Contractors, and construction management.
