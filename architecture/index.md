I have worked for architecture firms in Karachi, Austin, and New York City. Most recently, I worked at [David Hotson Architect](http://hotson.net/), a small boutique firm specializing in residential design, where I started out as Junior Designer on loft and brownstone renovations in Manhattan and Brooklyn and was later promoted to Project Manager. The projects I have worked on are—by and large—contemporary and minimalist in their aesthetic, and my responsibilities have included every aspect of their conception and execution: from schematic design to the preparation of construction drawings and specifications, from overseeing bidding to construction management.
